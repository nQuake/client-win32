2007-07-14 - nQuake v1.2

* nQuake is now the solid package it claims to be - the user has no choices as to what packages are installed.
* When uninstalling, user gets the choice of removing just the files nQuake installed, or removing the nQuake folder altogether.
* nQuake now backups old config file (ezquake/configs/config.cfg) if installed into an old Quake directory.
* Installer no longer temporarily creates a distfiles.log in the distfiles directory (useless).
* Setup is now clean of popup messages where they could be avoided.
* The installer has been generally cleaned up.

2007-07-09 - nQuake v1.1

* Installer now asks if it should keep the distribution files instead of asking to delete them.
* Installer now looks for pak1.pak on 21 likely locations. If pak1.pak is not found, the user gets to browse for it.
* Fixed the bug where nQuake wouldn't detect newer versions if the current version was x.0x.

2007-07-05 - nQuake v1.01

* Added link to gfx.qwdrama.com in Links.
* Fixed bug where installer doesn't remove distfiledates.ini from nquake-distfiles.
* Changed "Improved Visuals" to "Enhanced Graphics".
* Changed help/update links in program info (they were fQuake links in v1.0).

2007-07-01 - nQuake v1.0

* First public release.
